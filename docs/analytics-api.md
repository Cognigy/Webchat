# Analytics API

You can register to a set of various events that occur within the Webchat, from data flows like "a message was received from Cognigy" to interactions like "the webchat was closed".  
To do that, use the `webchat.registerAnalyticsService` function to execute a callback when events occur:

```javascript
webchat.registerAnalyticsService(event => {
	// react to the event that ocurred
});
```

If you e.g. want to react to incoming messages from Cognigy, you can do it like this:

```javascript
webchat.registerAnalyticsService(event => {
	if (event.type === "webchat/incoming-message") {
		console.log("incoming message: " + event.payload.text);
	}
});
```

Anytime an event is being emitted within the Webchat, it will cause the passed callback function to be executed.
The `event` object will always have a `type` property and may have a `payload` property depending on the event.
By checking for `event.type`, you can filter events for the ones you are interested in.

If you e.g. want to end session when user closes the webchat widget, you can do it like this:
```javascript
webchat.registerAnalyticsService(event => {
	if (event.type === "webchat/close") {
		webchat.endSession()
	}
})
``` 
This will end the current session and clear any messages from the session.
