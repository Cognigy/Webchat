# Webchat API

The `initWebchat()` method resolves a `webchat` object as soon as a connection is established, that can be used to access the Webchat's API.

For modern browsers, you can access it like this:

```
initWebchat('...').then(webchat => {
    // use webchat here
})
```

If you plan to support legacy browsers, there is an alternative syntax:

```
initWebchat('...', {}, function (webchat) {
    // use webchat here
})
```

For integrations with Websites, it is recommended to store the `webchat` object in the global window namespace for access all across the Website:

```
initWebchat('...').then(webchat => {
    window.webchat = webchat;
})
```

## Opening / Closing the Webchat

You can open the Webchat by calling `webchat.open()` or close it by calling `webchat.close()` at any time once it is loaded.
If you want to toggle the current open / close state, there is also a `webchat.toggle()` method.

## Sending Messages

You can use the Webchat API to send messages from outside of the Webchat via `webchat.sendMessage()`.

### Sending Text Messages

To send text messages, pass the text content as the first argument:

```javascript
webchat.sendMessage("hello world!");
```

### Sending Text and Data Messages

If you want to add data-output to your message, pass it as an object via a second argument, like this:

```javascript
webchat.sendMessage("hello world!", {
	origin: "sendMessage method",
});
```

### Sending Data-Only Messages

In case you want to send a data-only message, pass an empty string as the first argument:

```javascript
webchat.sendMessage("", {
	origin: "sendMessage method",
});
```

Note: By default, data-only messages will be invisible in the Chat History

### Sending a Message with an alternative Label

It is possible to override the visible message text by using a third parameter like this:

```javascript
webchat.sendMessage(
	"hello world!",
	{},
	{
		label: "foobar",
	},
);
```

### Showing notification in Chat

Shows a notification banner when the Webchat is open.

```javascript
webchat.showNotification("hello world!");
```

### Skipping the Start Screen

To skip the start screen and start the conversation immidiately, use startConversation method:

```javascript
webchat.startConversation();
```

## Update Settings

It is possible to update the webchat's settings at runtime using the `updateSettings` function.
It will receive an object as a parameter which will update all provided settings while leaving the remaining settings untouched.
Please note that only a subset of settings are safe to update at runtime. For further information, have a look at the [Endpoint Settings](./embedding.md#endpoint-settings).

```javascript
// this will disable the unread message preview at runtime
webchat.updateSettings({
	unreadMessages: {
		enablePreview: false,
	},
});
```
